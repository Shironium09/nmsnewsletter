        Background of History
    </h3>
    <p>
        Computer Science’s history, as a formal academic discipline goes deeper than its emergence in the 20th century, when we developed tools for calculation and logic. To get more in-depth we have to go back to the foundation of computer science and its theoretical concepts, there were many prominent figures that contributed to the development of computer science an example of this is Charles Babbage who had conceptualized the Analytical Engine which was considered to be the first design for a general purpose computer (Freiberger, 2024), and Ada Lovelace who is called the first computer programmer, she wrote an algorithm for Charles Babbages’ Analytical Engine (Britannica, 2024).

        Computer Science is relatively recent as a discipline, its roots can be traced back to the 18th century when a wider academic interest began because of the construction of the first Turing-complete computer, ENIAC (Freiberger, 2024). It took 20 years for Computer Science to acquire a distinct academic identity differentiated from like mathematics, engineering, physics, and logic instead researchers over the years have brought together different disciplines and philosophies from these fields and more although, this has came with the setback that made it difficult to distinguish from topics that are considered to be proper computer science (Tedre, 2007).

        Reaction/Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
        Computer science is inherently interdisciplinary, it often intersects with relevant fields (Heikkinen, 2018). Instead of being a standalone field it integrates various fields into its own discipline and philosophy examples of this can be found in a wise variety of concepts like mathematics, engineering, physics, psychology, biology, finance, and ethics this is why many regard computer science to be an important factor to the development of various areas of society.

        In conclusion, Computer Science has played an incredibly large role in the development of the society we know today, from the way it has opened up access to various mediums of communication, how easy it is to acquire information, advancements in engineering, healthcare, entertainment, transportation, and more.  However, these advancement come with issues such as privacy concerns, financing security concerns, and the digital divide. The future of Computer Science is expected to have innovations in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and quantum computing. As time goes, advancements in technology will be made and Computer Science will remain a critical discipline that will be utilize to solve problems in our society.

    5 COMPUTING DISCIPLINES AND MAJORS
</h2>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <h3 class="section-header">
        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are various disciplines that make up the field of computing Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Information Technology, and Information Systems. Although these disciplines are different in focus there is also a significant overlap between them (Vessy, 2005). As computing is interdisciplinary it shoud be acknowledged that there are more programs emerging as the field grows in influence (Lunt, 2008).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        Computer Science
    </h3>
    <p>
        It is the study of algorithms, data structures, software development, computer systems, and the theoretical foundations of computing. Computer Science draws heavily from mathematics and engineering this is why it integrates techniques from these fields like statistics and probability, queuing theory, and electronic circuit design (Tucker, 2024).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        Computer Engineering
    </h3>
    <p>
        It is the study of the design of hardware and software systems and is a blend of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (Lord, 2011). It focuses on the design, and development, development, and integration of hardware and software systems. It is involved with the creation of computing devices, from small embedded systems to large scale computing.
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        Software Engineering
    </h3>
    <p>
        It is a discipline that involves developing, maintaining, and testing of software systems. It focuses on the  design, methologies, and project management of the software (Belford, 2024).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        Information Technology
    </h3>
    <p>
        It is a discipline concerned with the use and management of computing technology to meet organizational needs, this includes systems administration, networking, and IT infrastructure. As the demand for information technologies increases, its availability and use grow with it, this resulted in companies investing in related services, these include different software platforms and databases (Dewett, 2001)
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
    Information Systems
    </h3>

    <p>
        The field involves the effective collection, processing, storing, and distribution of information. The establishment of Information Systems as an academic field stemmed from the needs of a myriad of different disciplines like Accounting, Business, Computer Science, and Management Science (Lenox, 2003).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
        Computing devices over the year have improved in their design, speed, and storage along with these capabilities the prices dropped with them. Because of these developments, computing elements are now the most commonly used and versatile electrical devices ever manufactured. Thus, the demand for additional computing sub disciplines emerged as a result of this adaptability and widespread use for a variety of application domains.
