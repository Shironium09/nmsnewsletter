        Number Systems are systems of writing numbers to express numbers. It provides a way of representing numbers using a specific set of symbols or digits related to a certain base (Rossi, 2022). Number Systems are defined by their use of a base, this determines how numbers are structured and presented (Lu, 2005).

        Historically, earlier forms of number systems were utiluzed by ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians and Babylonians where these systems were used for trade and commerce, and astronomy (Ifrah, 2000). The study of positional systems is key to understanding modern computing, where the binary systems are essential for digital operations (Penny, 1965).

        Isn computing, number systems are indispensable, particularly in the context of binary systems. The binary number system, which uses only two digits (0 and 1), is the foundation of digital computing. Similarly, hexadecimal and octal systems have often been used in Programming as well as Computer Engineering for more efficient representation of binary systems (Knuth, 1997)

    TYPES OF NUMBER SYSTEMS
</h2>
<div class="section-wrapper">
    <h3 class="section-header">
        DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM
    </h3>
    <p>
        The decimal system is the most widely used number system, utilizing ten digits, from 0 to 9. Each digit's position represents a power of 10. This is the standard system for most human-centric calculations (Britannica, 2024).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM
    </h3>
    <p>
        The binary system is used in digital electronics and computing. Utilizing only two digits, from 0 and 1. Each digit represents a power of 2. This system is fundamental in computer architecture and programming (Kov√°cs, 2001).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM
    </h3>
    <p>
        The octal system uses eight digits, from 0 to 7. It is less common today but was used in older computing systems. It simplifies binary representation by grouping binary digits in sets of three (Plantz, 1971).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        HEXADECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM
    </h3>
    <p>
        The hexadecimal system uses sixteen symbols, from 0-9 and A-F (where A represents 10 and F represents 15). It is widely used in computing and digital electronics because of its concise representation of binary values (Latif, 2011).
    </p>
    <h3 class="section-header">
        OTHER NUMBER SYSTEM
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are other specialized systems like the Quinary (Base 5) and Duodecimal (Base 12), also Sexagesimal (Base 60) is one of the earliest known systems of writing and numbering, developed by the Sumerians in ancient Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE (Walker, 1987). These systems have been used historically or in specific scientific contexts (e.g., astronomy or timekeeping).

    </h3>
    <p>
        The binary number system, which uses only two digits (0 and 1), is foundational in computer science. The binary system's simplicity allows for straightforward implementation in electronic circuits, where two states (on and off) can represent all forms of data, enabling efficient data processing and storage (Chakraborty & Sao, 2014).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In contrast, the decimal number system, which is the most commonly used system in everyday life, is crucial for human cognitive processing and education. Strong foundation in the decimal system is essential for developing mathematical skills (Geary, 2013). The decimal system's structure allows for straightforward representation of rational numbers, which is crucial in educational contexts, particularly in teaching arithmetic and understanding numerical magnitudes (Liu et. al., 2014).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The octal system, while less common than decimal and binary, finds its applications primarily in computing and digital systems. It allows for a more compact representation of binary numbers which is particularly useful in programming and data manipulation (Elrahim, 2014).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hexadecimal (base-16), also has significance in computing, particularly in programming and memory addressing. Hexadecimal provides a more human-readable format for binary data, making it easier for programmers to interpret large binary numbers (Roy, 2008).

        CONCLUSION
    </h3>
    <p>
        In summary, each of these systems decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal plays a crucial role in various domains, facilitating operations that range from simple arithmetic to complex computational tasks. The significance of these number systems is deeply rooted in their applications across different fields.
