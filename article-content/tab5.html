        Motherboards come in different shapes and sizes each designed to be placed inside different kinds of computers and work with differrent types of processors and memory. Popular forms of motherboards are the ATX, micro-ATX, and the mini-ITX series. Each of these come with different quantity of slots for CPU, RAM, and expansion, they also have different built in features. These distinctions help in determining the correct motherboard to choose depending on your needs for example gaming, work purposes, or light compact builds.
