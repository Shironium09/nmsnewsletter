        <li>
            <h4>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h4>
            <p>Often called the "brain" of the computer, the CPU processes instructions from software and performs calculations to carry out tasks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Motherboard</h4>
            <p>This is the main circuit board that connects all components, allowing them to communicate. It houses the CPU, RAM, and storage connectors and provides slots for expansion cards.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Motherboard</h4>
            <p>Random Access Memory temporarily holds data that the CPU needs for quick access. More RAM generally means better multitasking capabilities, as more data can be processed simultaneously.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h4>
            <p>The GPU handles rendering images and video. High-performance GPUs are critical for gaming, video editing, and applications that require intense graphical computations.</p>

        Computer Hardware has made incredible strides over the years, and its sophistication only growing exponentially as more technological advancememts are made. This rapid growth has allowed for increase in capable and complex software applications, even the in new areas as artificial intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR), and High-Definition Video Gaming.

        Moore's law, the that states that the number of transistors per silicon chip doubles every years (Britannica, 2024). Has been the foundation for computer technology. However, according to Schaller (1997) this rapid and steady growth will soon slow down due to physical and economic limits.

        One challenge that this industry faces is its negative impacts on climate change. As hardware becomes more powerful and sophisticated, the demand for electricity will become much more evident. Modern technology needs to be mass-produced, meaning the factories resposible for this mass productions will increase  their greenhouse gas emissions leading to the worsening of climate change (Dwevidi, 2022).

        Software is are just sets of instruction, data, or programs used to execute specific task in computers. Where hardware are the physical components of a computer, software is purely digital, it exist as code and to be executed by hardware. There are also different categories for software including system software, application software, and specialized software. Software is an essential component of modern technology, it drives every aspect of our digital experience and it is what shaped how we communicate, work, and interact in our current world.

        Software is usually stored in external long-term memory devices an example is the hard drive but to execute it the computer reads it from the storage device and stores the instructions temporarily in random access memory (RAM) (Britannica, 2024).  Open source software is software that allows anyone to contribute to its development, it is released with a license that allows users to modify, and distribute its source code (Wei, 2011). Popular open source projects have demonstrated the power of open source software for their flexibility, security, speed, and stability making them favored by users (Britannica, 2024).

        Software engineering is about how to approach design, development,  testing, and maintenance of software applications. It involves engineering principles and practices to make sure the process of developments is systematic and efficient (Tucker and Belford, 2024). Its objective is to build software that fits the user need while also considering constraints like time, budget, and technical limits. The rapid growth of the internet has brought us significant benefits but also exposed us to dangers. Cybersecurity is essential for both businesses and individuals especially when they use software applications as they are prime targets for hackers. Therefore secure software engineering practices become all the more crucial (Jøsang, 2015).

        Hardware and software are  the foundation of the digital world, these two serve very different roles. Hardware consist of physical devices like computers, servers, smartphones, and network components. While software includes the programs, operating systems, and applications that gives the instructions for the hardware to execute (Britannica, 2024). The combinations of these two are what makes it possible to create functional systems tailored to the user's needs in whatever field they operate. In the modern world, hardware and software are now used everyday for institutions for healthcare, education, government agencies, and businesses, the applications of these vary on the institution's objective, infrastructure, and what the user needs.

        Schools and universities often use hardware like computers, projectors, interactive whiteboards, and tablets. In higher education, specialized hardware such as computer labs and VR devices are common to support scientific research, digital art, or engineering simulations (Hesel, 1992). Hospitals and clinics rely on a wide array of hardware, including computers for patient records, diagnostic machines like MRI scanners and X-ray machines, aee also kinds of computer hardware used in healthcare (CDC, 2024). In government institutions, hardware like desktops, servers, and network devices are essential for running public administration and keeping records. Hardware in businesses varies significantly by industry; for instance, manufacturing may use IoT-enabled devices for inventory management and production automation, while tech companies might prioritize high-performance workstations for software development, data processing, and design (Mashayekhy et.al., 2022).

        Educational institutions deploy a variety of software applications, such as learning management systems (LMS), grading software, and digital assessment tools. Software like Google Classroom, or Codechum helps teachers manage lessons, track student progress, and facilitate collaboration. Hospitals use software like electronic health records (EHR) systems to keep track of patient information and medical histories securely (Thorpe, 2024). Government institutions use various software to manage data securely and efficiently, from CRM systems for citizen management to tax collection software, databases, licensing, voting, and legal records. For Businesses, transaction processing systems are used to support e-commerce over the Internet. These systems include online shopping, banking, and securities trading. Other systems deliver information, educational services, and entertainment on demand.
